Roid is Google Maps on Steroids. It combines the brute force of google maps' API with the ability to receive crowd-source information from its users

Conventionally, companies pay to have there business featured on google maps, through targeted advertising. While Roid does not necessarily avoid that (since it still uses Google Maps API), it allows the user to also view other information. Currently Roid gathers data from Kijiji, Yelp and Eventbrite to provide the user with information they would not normally find on google maps. Furthermore, users can "create events" that other users can see in the future. Currently, Roid allows users to create "food", "shopping", "washrooms", "garbage cans", and "events" events.

Roid currently runs on a Google Cloud server. It uses Vue JS to host its web-app, Standard Library to host its APIs, AirTable to host its database, and Python to continuously gather information. Furthermore an Android app is available and fully functional.
